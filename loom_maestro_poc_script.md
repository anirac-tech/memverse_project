## Recording Script

### ðŸŽ¬ Opening (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Desktop with project folder visible]**

> "Hi everyone! Today I'm going to show you Maestro - a revolutionary mobile UI testing framework
> that makes testing iOS and Android apps incredibly simple.
>
> By the end of this demo, you'll understand what Maestro is, why it's amazing, and see it working
> live on our Memverse app. Let's dive in!"

### ðŸ“š What is Maestro? (90 seconds)

**[Screen: Switch to browser with Maestro documentation]**

> "First, what is Maestro?
>
> Maestro is a mobile UI testing framework that lets you write tests using simple YAML files - no
> complex programming required. Think of it as automating exactly what a human would do: tap buttons,
> enter text, and verify what appears on screen.
>
> **[Point to key features on screen]**
> - Works on both iOS and Android
> - Tests run on real devices or emulators
> - Takes screenshots automatically
> - Can record videos of test execution
> - Uses simple, readable YAML syntax
>
> The best part? Anyone can write these tests - QA engineers, developers, even non-technical team
> members!"

### ðŸ”§ Live Setup Demo (60 seconds)

**[Screen: Switch to terminal in project directory]**

> "Now let's see Maestro in action. I'm going to use our automated setup script that checks
> everything and gets us ready for testing.
>
> **[Type command while explaining]**
> ```bash
> ./maestro_prep.sh
> ```
>
> Watch how this script automatically:
> - Checks if all required tools are installed
> - Verifies our Android device is connected
> - Builds our Flutter app with the correct configuration
> - Installs the app on the device
> - Confirms everything is ready for testing
>
> **[Show colored output as script runs]**
> See those green checkmarks? That means everything is working perfectly!"

### ðŸŽ¯ Live Test Execution (120 seconds)

**[Screen: Terminal + visible Android device]**

> "Now for the exciting part - let's run an actual test!
>
> This test simulates a common user mistake: trying to login without entering username or password.
> Our app should show helpful error messages.
>
> **[Type command]**
> ```bash
> maestro test maestro/flows/login/empty_login_validation.yaml
> ```
>
> **[Watch test execute, narrate what's happening]**
> - Maestro connects to our device
> - App launches automatically
> - It taps the Login button without entering credentials
> - App shows validation errors: 'Please enter your username' and 'Please enter your password'
> - Test captures screenshots at each step
> - All assertions pass with green checkmarks!
>
> **[Show device screen during execution]**
> You can see on the device exactly what's happening - it's like watching a robot user interact with
> our app!"

### ðŸ“¸ Results Review (90 seconds)

**[Screen: Terminal showing success + file explorer with screenshots]**

> "The test completed successfully! Let's look at what Maestro captured for us.
>
> **[Open screenshot directory]**
> ```bash
> open ~/.maestro/tests/$(ls -t ~/.maestro/tests | head -1)
> ```
>
> **[Show screenshots one by one]**
> Here are the automatic screenshots:
> - 'login_screen_empty' - Shows the initial login screen
> - 'empty_login_validation_error' - Captures the error state
> - 'validation_messages_visible' - Confirms error messages appeared
>
> This visual documentation is incredibly valuable for debugging and demonstrating that our
> validation works correctly!"

### ðŸŽ¥ Video Recording Capabilities (60 seconds)

**[Screen: Terminal with video recording commands]**

> "Maestro can also record videos of test execution. There are two approaches:
>
> **Local Recording**: Records your actual device screen - higher quality, immediate access
> **Remote Recording**: Uses Maestro Cloud - standardized environment, easy sharing
>
> **[Show example commands]**
> ```bash
> # Local recording (what we just did)
> maestro test maestro/flows/login/empty_login_validation.yaml --format junit
> 
> # Remote recording (requires Maestro Cloud)
> maestro cloud maestro/flows/login/empty_login_validation.yaml
> ```
>
> The choice depends on your needs - local for development, remote for CI/CD and team sharing."

### ðŸš€ Next Steps & Benefits (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Back to project structure showing test files]**

> "What makes this powerful is how easy it is to expand:
> - Add more test scenarios by creating new YAML files
> - Test happy paths, error cases, edge conditions
> - Run tests automatically in CI/CD pipelines
> - Anyone on the team can write and maintain these tests
>
> **[Show file structure]**
> All our tests are organized in the maestro/flows directory, ready to grow with our needs."

### ðŸŽ¯ Closing (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Desktop with successful test results visible]**

> "That's Maestro in a nutshell! In just 5 minutes, we've:
> - Set up a complete testing environment
> - Executed a real-world test scenario
> - Captured visual documentation
> - Validated our app's error handling
>
> The best part? This entire process can be repeated by anyone on the team with zero Maestro
> experience, thanks to our automated setup and clear documentation.
>
