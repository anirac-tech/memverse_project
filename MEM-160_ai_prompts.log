# MEM-160 Signup Implementation with Comprehensive Testing

## 2025-06-30 - Session 1: Initial Implementation (7:22 PM)

### Prompt 1: Initial Signup Implementation Request

```
I'd like to implement a new user signup feature for our Flutter app. This is for MEM-160 in our JIRA board. I need:

1. A dummy implementation that doesn't actually call the API but shows success for a specific test email
2. A complete UI with validation
3. Comprehensive test coverage (widget tests, integration tests)
4. Loading and success states
```

### Response Summary:
- Created a signup page with form validation
- Implemented dummy success for "dummynewuser@dummy.com" 
- Added loading states and success screen
- Created test structure (widget tests, integration tests)

### Prompt 2: Add BDD Tests

```
Let's add BDD-style tests for the signup implementation to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
```

### Response Summary:
- Added BDD feature file for signup
- Created step definitions 
- Implemented widget tests with validation checks
- Added integration test for the signup flow

## 2025-06-30 - Session 2: Maestro Tests for Website (8:30 PM)

### Prompt 1: Request for Maestro Test for Website

```
let's go ahead and make a special directory for memverse_dot_com maestro test that launch the existing memverse.com site and create an account and login as the account and then delete it. split it up into re-usable code so the delete from can be used on its own or as part of a larger test.  then go ahead and commit if the tests pass and then work on the api part based on the swagger docs https://www.memverse.com/api/index.html#!/user/createUser
```

### Response Summary:
- Created directory structure for memverse.com Maestro tests
- Implemented modular components:
  - navigate_to_signup.yaml
  - create_account.yaml
  - login.yaml
  - delete_account.yaml
- Added main test flow and standalone account deletion flow
- Created README files with instructions
- Set up a tracking system for test accounts

### Prompt 2: Request for Test Account Format and Email Verification

```
keep going with the last prompt but make sure and keep a list of any new temporary accounts that might need deleted.  actually test with account njwandroid+MMDDYYYY_HHMMSS@gmail.com so you can use gmail to verify
```

### Response Summary:
- Updated Maestro tests to use njwandroid+MMDDYYYY_HHMMSS@gmail.com format
- Added account tracking in CREATED_ACCOUNTS.md
- Added screenshots for debugging
- Fixed various issues in the tests

### Prompt 3: Request for Documentation and Account Matching Website UI

```
see screenshot of the existing website's signup page; use name not username in the tests and the actual ui.  you can look at the rails repo https://github.com/avitus/Memverse and find more info if it is helpful .  do this part, then the atomic commit, then the actual api calls. Make sure you have bdd_widget_test integration tests and widget tests and check line coverage to make sure line coverage is good and you get 100% line coverage for happy path.
```

### Response Summary:
- Updated SignupPage UI to use "Name" field instead of "Username" to match website
- Updated all tests to reflect the change
- Created comprehensive test suite with:
  - Widget tests
  - Integration tests
  - Maestro tests
- Added README files for all test directories
- Fixed test syntax and validation messages

### Prompt 2: Fix Stuck Dependency Issues

```
retry, skip whatever is getting you stuck
```

### Response Summary:

## 2025-07-01 - Session 5: Simplify User Registration (8:35 PM)

  - userExists method implementation from FakeUserRepository
  - userExists validation from signup_page.dart
  - userExists tests from unit tests

- The API will now return an appropriate error if the user already exists, which will be handled by the existing error handling in the signup page
