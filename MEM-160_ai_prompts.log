2025-06-30 07:22:07 PM - User Story 1: New User Signup (Happy Path) - Generate plan of attack with Maestro BDD approach, failing tests first, then implementation. Enhance plan of attack with BDD test generation and mocking analysis. Timeline: 7:10pm start, 7:50pm target completion.

User Story:
As a new user, I want to successfully create an account on Memverse, So that I can access and utilize the platform's features.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Successful Account Creation with Valid Credentials
- Navigate to signup page (https://memverse-demo.netlify.app/)
- Provide unique valid email, username, strong password
- Submit signup form
- Create user via POST to https://www.memverse.com/api/index.html#!/user/createUser
- Auto login and redirect to dashboard/welcome
- Success message displayed
- API returns 200 OK with user details

Approach: Maestro BDD - write failing test first, then implement code to pass

USER PROMPT: add to the plan of attack generating bdd_widget_test gherkin files so we can get good coverage percentage in all 3 types of testing: 1) Live integration test scenarios that I manually cleanup 2) Mocked integration test scenarios and 3) mocked widget test scenarios. Please make a charlatan_vs_mockdio_analysis.md file that we can consider in a future story/PR

RESPONSE SUMMARY: 
- Updated plan of attack in DITL with BDD test generation strategy
- Created charlatan_vs_mockdio_analysis.md with comprehensive comparison
- Enhanced coverage strategy for 3 test types: live integration, mocked integration, mocked widget
- Added Gherkin file generation to project workflow

ACTION ITEMS:
- Generate BDD widget test Gherkin files for comprehensive coverage
- Consider Charlatan vs Mockito for future mocking strategy
- Implement 3-tiered testing approach: live, mocked integration, mocked widget

USER PROMPT: ok, now go ahead and create the live maestro tests for happy path with the real api and then make them pass, please do update your analysis for fake_dio rather than mockdio see https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod/blob/master/examples/marvel/lib/src/fake_marvel.dart that's what i want to compare to charlatan from pub.dev

RESPONSE SUMMARY: 
- Creating live Maestro tests for signup happy path with real API
- Updated analysis to compare fake_dio vs Charlatan (not Mockito)
- Implementing failing tests first, then making them pass
- Using Riverpod pattern from Marvel example for fake implementations

ACTION ITEMS:
- Create Maestro signup test with real API calls
- Update charlatan analysis to compare with fake_dio approach
- Implement signup functionality to make tests pass
- Follow Riverpod fake provider pattern from Marvel example

USER PROMPT: oh, last thing, keep going with what you're doing but make a "dummy" setup FIRST to make the maestro tests work where signing up for "dummynewuser@dummy.com" is hardwired to pretend to create an account with dummy ui, then once that passes keep that hardcoded ui for now so i can test it manually and then make it work with live api. Please open an emulator so i can use it while you work

RESPONSE SUMMARY: 
- Creating dummy signup UI first to make Maestro tests pass
- Hardcoded "dummynewuser@dummy.com" signup flow
- Opening Android emulator for testing
- Will implement live API after dummy version passes
- BDD approach: dummy first, then real implementation

ACTION ITEMS:
- Open Android emulator for testing
- Create dummy signup page with hardcoded success
- Make Maestro test pass with dummy implementation
- Then implement real API integration

========== 2025-06-30 07:46:45 PM ==========
USER PROMPT: go ahead and modify the charlatan_vs file to reflect fake_marvel.dart or similar which is pointing the mock/fake api calls to json files with jsonliteral annotation similar to square's mockwebserver. Then go ahead and make bdd_widget_test files for dummynewuser@dummy.com and let me know if you think it is ready for the first atomic commit. in fact, a signup for dummynewuser@dummy.com is so simple let's create an ordinary integration test for it so we have all 4 1) maestro, 2) bdd_widget_test and 3) regular integration tests and 4) Regular widget tests - since dummynewuser@dummy.com should not require an internet connection at all or any http calls - override how you see fit in widget tests to achieve this. We're getting short on time, please utilize flutter run to achieve this goal, even the clientid is not mandatory for this sort of dummy task objective. you can use hot restart with "R" and hot reload with "r" if you use flutter run

RESPONSE SUMMARY: 
- Creating all 4 test types for dummy signup
- Updating charlatan analysis to reflect fake JSON approach
- No internet/HTTP calls needed for dummy signup
- Using flutter run for fast iteration
- Preparing for atomic commit

ACTION ITEMS:
- Update charlatan_vs analysis with fake JSON approach
- Create BDD widget test for dummy signup
- Create regular integration test
- Create regular widget test
- All 4 test types: Maestro, BDD widget, integration, widget
- Test dummy signup without internet connection
