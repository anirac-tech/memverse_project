**User Prompt:**
```
please add the password hide/show eye to the create account/signup screen
```

**Response Summary:**
Added password visibility toggle functionality to the signup screen:

1. **Added State Management:**
   - Added `isPasswordVisible` useState hook to track password visibility state

2. **Updated Password Field:**
   - Changed `obscureText` to use `!isPasswordVisible.value` (dynamic)
   - Added `suffixIcon` with eye icon button
   - Icon switches between `Icons.visibility` (show) and `Icons.visibility_off` (hide)
   - IconButton toggles the visibility state when pressed

3. **User Experience:**
   - Password starts hidden by default (`isPasswordVisible.value = false`)
   - Users can tap the eye icon to show/hide password
   - Visual feedback with appropriate icons
   - Consistent with login page behavior

The signup screen now has the same password visibility toggle functionality as modern apps, improving user experience when entering passwords.

**User Prompt:**
```
please make sure the password widget with the show/hide eye is a reusable widget rather than duplicate code between signup and signin
```

**Response Summary:**
Created a reusable PasswordField widget to eliminate code duplication between login and signup screens:

1. **Created New Reusable Widget:**
   - `lib/src/common/widgets/password_field.dart`
   - HookWidget with comprehensive configuration options
   - Supports both internal and external visibility state management
   - Customizable labels, hints, validation, and callbacks

2. **Widget Features:**
   - **Flexible Configuration**: labelText, hintText, validator, textInputAction
   - **Focus Management**: Optional focusNode parameter
   - **State Management**: Internal useState or external ValueNotifier support
   - **Callbacks**: onFieldSubmitted, onVisibilityToggle
   - **Testability**: fieldKey parameter for testing

3. **Updated Both Pages:**
   - **Signup Page**: Replaced inline password field with PasswordField widget
   - **Login Page**: Replaced complex inline implementation with PasswordField
   - **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features preserved (analytics, validation, etc.)

4. **Key Benefits:**
   - **DRY Principle**: Single source of truth for password field behavior
   - **Consistency**: Same UX across all password fields in the app
   - **Maintainability**: Changes to password field behavior only need to be made in one place
   - **Testability**: Reusable testing keys and consistent behavior

5. **Advanced Features:**
   - **External State Support**: Login page can manage visibility state externally for analytics
   - **Internal State Fallback**: Signup page uses internal state management
   - **Full Customization**: All TextFormField properties configurable

The password field functionality is now properly abstracted into a reusable component that can be used throughout the app while maintaining all existing functionality and adding consistent behavior.

**User Prompt:**
```
any guesses why we still get a when trying to signin?

Does the rails site use the api for signup or not? https://github.com/avitus/Memverse. I still get a 404 when i try to run the app and signin, can you generate me a curl command and add curlinterceptor so i can compare them and perhaps use chrome dev tools to get curl from swagger?  Put good steps related to this in troubleshot_signup_api_call.md . I think it's "ordinary" oauth flow like twitter was in 2019 or earlier, so please feel free to "just fix it" if you can from the swagger or the github repo .  swagger again is https://www.memverse.com/api/index.html#!/user/createUser
```

**Response Summary:**
Created comprehensive debugging tools and troubleshooting documentation for the 404 signup API error:

1. **Created Troubleshooting Document:**
   - `troubleshoot_signup_api_call.md` with step-by-step debugging guide
   - Multiple cURL command variations to test different endpoint patterns
   - Chrome DevTools integration steps
   - Common Rails API patterns and solutions

2. **Created CurlLoggingInterceptor:**
   - `lib/src/common/interceptors/curl_logging_interceptor.dart`
   - Generates equivalent cURL commands for all Dio requests
   - Detailed request/response logging with emojis for clarity
   - Error handling with response data inspection

3. **Fixed API Implementation Issues:**
   - **Changed Content-Type**: From `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` to `application/json`
   - **Added password_confirmation**: Rails typically requires this field
   - **Multiple Endpoint Testing**: Tries `/api/v1/users`, `/api/1/users`, `/api/users`
   - **Better Error Handling**: Continues trying endpoints on 404, fails fast on other errors

4. **Key Debugging Features:**
   - **Smart Endpoint Fallback**: Automatically tries common Rails patterns
   - **Detailed Logging**: Shows exactly what's being sent and received
   - **cURL Generation**: Can copy/paste generated commands for manual testing
   - **Comprehensive Error Messages**: Includes specific troubleshooting guidance

5. **Identified Likely Issues:**
   - Wrong endpoint URL (common in Rails APIs)
   - Incorrect content type (JSON vs form-urlencoded)
   - Missing required fields (password_confirmation)
   - Authentication format variations (Basic vs Bearer)

The implementation now automatically tries multiple common Rails API endpoint patterns and provides detailed debugging output to identify the exact issue. The troubleshooting document includes manual cURL commands that can be tested independently to isolate the problem.
