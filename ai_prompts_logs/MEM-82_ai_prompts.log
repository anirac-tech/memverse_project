AI Response Snippet (create_release.sh summary):
Okay, I've modified the `scripts/create_release.sh` script according to your requirements.

Here's a summary of the changes:

1.  **Argument Parsing:** Added support for `--flavor <name>`, `--dry-run`, `--auto`, and `-h`/`--help`.
2.  **Help (`--help`/`-h`):** Displays usage instructions and exits.
3.  **Dry Run (`--dry-run`):** When present, the script prints the commands it *would* execute (prefixed with `DRY RUN:`) without making any changes.
4.  **Auto Run (`--auto`):** When present, the script runs non-interactively. It uses the current semantic version, generates automatic release notes, and skips the confirmation prompt. If both `--auto` and `--dry-run` are specified, `--dry-run` takes precedence.
5.  **Default Behavior (no flags):**
    *   The script first shows the list of "Planned Actions" (effectively a dry run).
    *   It then prompts interactively for the new semantic version (defaulting to the current one) and release notes.
    *   Finally, it asks for confirmation (`Do you want to proceed...? [Y/n]`) with 'Y' as the default before executing the actions.
6.  **Execution Logic:** Commands that modify state (git, flutter, sed, rm) are now run through a `run_command` function that respects the `--dry-run` flag.
7.  **Cleanup:** Uses `trap` to ensure the temporary release notes file (`/tmp/memverse_release_notes.*.txt`) is always deleted on script exit, whether it finishes successfully or fails.
8.  **Input Handling:** Prompts for version and notes are skipped in `--auto` and pure `--dry-run` modes, using defaults instead. Interactive mode now defaults the semantic version prompt to the current version.

You can now run the script in several ways:

*   `./scripts/create_release.sh -h`: Show help.
*   `./scripts/create_release.sh`: Default behavior (show plan, prompt for input, ask for confirmation).
*   `./scripts/create_release.sh --flavor production`: Run for the 'production' flavor (still with default confirmation behavior).
*   `./scripts/create_release.sh --dry-run`: Show what would happen without executing.
*   `./scripts/create_release.sh --auto`: Run automatically without prompts or confirmation, using defaults.
*   `./scripts/create_release.sh --flavor development --auto`: Run automatically for the 'development' flavor.
