2025-05-28 11:32:41 PM - Prompt: Please generate a complete suite of maestro tests for this project along an easy way to safely record such as https://github.com/njwandroid/NJWKotlinWebHostFlutterModuleNav/blob/11-real-world-aspect-with-mock-billing-api/maestro/scripts/run_maestro_test.sh and then also create a suite of integration tests with bdd_widget_tests and appropriate gherkin files

Summary: Created comprehensive testing infrastructure including:
- Maestro test framework with run_maestro_test.sh script for recording and running UI tests
- Complete Maestro flows for login, navigation, and verse management
- BDD widget tests using bdd_widget_test package with Gherkin feature files
- Documentation files (gherkin_tests.md and maestro_tests.md) with instructions and FAQs
- Test configuration utilities for handling environment variables and live credentials
- Support for live login credentials via dart defines and environment variables

2025-05-28 11:33:15 PM - Prompt: please make integration tests with bdd_widget_test as well, and get as close to 100% test coverage as possible given that we can login with live user credentials with env variables via dart defines like test_setup.md - ie --dart-define=USERNAME=$MEMVERSE_USERNAME --dart-define=PASSWORD=$MEMVERSE_PASSWORD --dart-define=CLIENT_ID=$MEMVERSE_CLIENT_ID . also make a gherkin_tests.md and maestro_tests.md with some nice explanations, faq, instructions on running it, links for more information etc

Summary: Extended testing framework with comprehensive documentation and integration test features for achieving high test coverage using live credentials.

2025-05-28 11:34:20 PM - Prompt: for now please remove the entire ui and logic that outputs "5 references due today" (or whatever number of references due) since it is incorrect and not that valuable. Then resume with the last prompt

Summary: Removed the "references due today" UI component and related logic from:
- StatsAndHistorySection widget (removed overdueReferences parameter and display)
- MemversePage (removed overdueReferences state and counter logic)
- Updated all related test files to remove overdueReferences references
- Fixed linting issues and ensured tests pass

2025-05-28 11:35:30 PM - Prompt: ok,, now delete the mem-97_ai prompts and 100 and make a 139ai prompts with prompts and summaries from this session. Then remove the Question: 1 (or whatever) caption and variable UI at the top and all related logic and code, then resume last prompt. When finished make sure you think the pipeline will pass please

Summary: Managing AI prompts logs, removing question number UI, and continuing with comprehensive BDD integration tests. Focus on ensuring pipeline compatibility and test coverage.

2025-05-29 12:00:00 AM - Prompt: please modify all integration test running scripts to grep the results of flutter devices in order to not wait for user input but to run tests on a specific device intentionally.

Summary: Updated integration test scripts for automatic device detection:
- Modified scripts/integration_tests.sh to automatically detect and select devices
- Updated scripts/run_bdd_tests.sh with device auto-selection
- Created scripts/device_utils.sh as reusable utility for device detection
- Priority order: Chrome/web devices first (CI-friendly), then emulators, then first available
- All scripts now use flutter devices output to avoid user input prompts

2025-05-29 12:05:00 AM - Prompt: use Flutter 3.32.0 in pubspec.yaml, github actions, netlify.toml, scripts, etc - everywhere a flutter version is specified

Summary: Updated Flutter version to 3.32.0 and Dart to 3.8.0 across all configuration files:
- pubspec.yaml: Updated SDK constraints to >=3.8.0 and Flutter >=3.32.0
- netlify.toml: Updated FLUTTER_VERSION to 3.32.0
- scripts/project_config.sh: Updated FLUTTER_VERSION to 3.32.0
- .github/workflows/deploy_web_firebase.yaml: Updated flutter-version to 3.32.0
- .github/workflows/deploy_web_github_pages.yaml: Updated flutter-version to 3.32.0
- netlify_deploy.md: Updated documentation reference to Flutter 3.32.0
- Other workflow files already use dynamic version extraction from project config

2025-05-30 10:03:11 PM - Prompt: please look over the current code and make maestro tests and bdd_widget_test integration tests to cover entire happy path given username njwandroid@gmaiml.com and password "fixmeplaceholder' and first reference "Col 1:17" is correct and for the second reference "Gal 5:1" is orange / almost correct
Response: Exploring codebase to understand structure and create comprehensive Maestro and BDD widget tests for the happy path scenario with specified login credentials and verse references. Will check existing test patterns and implement complete integration tests.

2025-05-30 10:23:15 PM - Prompt: please put this prompt in ai interactions log, then please make a maestro_recording.md with info on how to view the recording - preferably with an emulator like in the remote github repo. please make a coverage_next_steps.md with information on the flows, branches and line numbers not covered with that 74.3% and some proposed strategies to gain coverage please. Keep in mind this should be for integration tests which should be very easy to get coverage for everything except exception handling (since live APIs will not reliably generate exceptions). so i would expect only a few catch clauses to not be covered with live bdd_widget integration tests. Then also review your last prompt and make sure every thing is done and works and you expect the pipeline to pass.
Response: Adding final documentation for Maestro recording setup with emulator instructions, analyzing coverage gaps for the 74.3% result to identify uncovered branches/lines and propose strategies for higher integration test coverage, and conducting final review to ensure pipeline compatibility and completion of all deliverables.

[2025-05-30 10:35:00 PM] FINAL COMPLETION: Updated Maestro recording script to match the referenced GitHub repository pattern while incorporating the --continuous flag for efficient development testing. Created comprehensive documentation including maestro_recording.md with emulator setup instructions and coverage_next_steps.md with detailed analysis of the 74.3% coverage results. All deliverables are complete and the pipeline should pass successfully.

Summary: âœ… ALL PHASES COMPLETE - Created comprehensive Maestro and BDD widget test infrastructure covering the entire happy path with secure credential handling, efficient development workflows, and detailed documentation. Project includes 9 test files, 2 documentation guides, and achieves 74.3% test coverage with roadmap to 90%+. Ready for production pipeline deployment.
