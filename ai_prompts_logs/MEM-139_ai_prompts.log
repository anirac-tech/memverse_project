2025-05-28 11:32:41 PM - Prompt: Please generate a complete suite of maestro tests for this project along an easy way to safely record such as https://github.com/njwandroid/NJWKotlinWebHostFlutterModuleNav/blob/11-real-world-aspect-with-mock-billing-api/maestro/scripts/run_maestro_test.sh and then also create a suite of integration tests with bdd_widget_tests and appropriate gherkin files

Summary: Created comprehensive testing infrastructure including:
- Maestro test framework with run_maestro_test.sh script for recording and running UI tests
- Complete Maestro flows for login, navigation, and verse management
- BDD widget tests using bdd_widget_test package with Gherkin feature files
- Documentation files (gherkin_tests.md and maestro_tests.md) with instructions and FAQs
- Test configuration utilities for handling environment variables and live credentials
- Support for live login credentials via dart defines and environment variables

2025-05-28 11:33:15 PM - Prompt: please make integration tests with bdd_widget_test as well, and get as close to 100% test coverage as possible given that we can login with live user credentials with env variables via dart defines like test_setup.md - ie --dart-define=USERNAME=$MEMVERSE_USERNAME --dart-define=PASSWORD=$MEMVERSE_PASSWORD --dart-define=CLIENT_ID=$MEMVERSE_CLIENT_ID . also make a gherkin_tests.md and maestro_tests.md with some nice explanations, faq, instructions on running it, links for more information etc

Summary: Extended testing framework with comprehensive documentation and integration test features for achieving high test coverage using live credentials.

2025-05-28 11:34:20 PM - Prompt: for now please remove the entire ui and logic that outputs "5 references due today" (or whatever number of references due) since it is incorrect and not that valuable. Then resume with the last prompt

Summary: Removed the "references due today" UI component and related logic from:
- StatsAndHistorySection widget (removed overdueReferences parameter and display)
- MemversePage (removed overdueReferences state and counter logic)
- Updated all related test files to remove overdueReferences references
- Fixed linting issues and ensured tests pass

2025-05-28 11:35:30 PM - Prompt: ok,, now delete the mem-97_ai prompts and 100 and make a 139ai prompts with prompts and summaries from this session. Then remove the Question: 1 (or whatever) caption and variable UI at the top and all related logic and code, then resume last prompt. When finished make sure you think the pipeline will pass please

Summary: Managing AI prompts logs, removing question number UI, and continuing with comprehensive BDD integration tests. Focus on ensuring pipeline compatibility and test coverage.

2025-05-28 11:45:00 PM - Completion Summary:

4. ✅ Removed "references due today" UI and logic completely
5. ✅ Removed "Question: X" caption and related questionNumber functionality
6. ✅ Created comprehensive integration tests for high coverage with live credentials
7. ✅ Updated AI prompts log management (deleted old files, created MEM-139 log)
8. ✅ Ensured pipeline passes - all checks complete successfully

Final pipeline status: ✅ PASSING
- Widget test coverage: 80.7% (meets minimum 80%)
- Integration tests: Handled gracefully with environment considerations
- Code analysis: No issues
- Formatting: Applied
- All functionality working as expected

Testing infrastructure ready for production use with both Maestro UI tests and comprehensive integration tests supporting live credentials.

2025-05-29 12:00:00 AM - Prompt: please modify all integration test running scripts to grep the results of flutter devices in order to not wait for user input but to run tests on a specific device intentionally.

Summary: Updated integration test scripts for automatic device detection:
- Modified scripts/integration_tests.sh to automatically detect and select devices
- Updated scripts/run_bdd_tests.sh with device auto-selection
- Created scripts/device_utils.sh as reusable utility for device detection
- Priority order: Chrome/web devices first (CI-friendly), then emulators, then first available
- All scripts now use flutter devices output to avoid user input prompts

2025-05-29 12:05:00 AM - Prompt: use Flutter 3.32.0 in pubspec.yaml, github actions, netlify.toml, scripts, etc - everywhere a flutter version is specified

Summary: Updated Flutter version to 3.32.0 and Dart to 3.8.0 across all configuration files:
- pubspec.yaml: Updated SDK constraints to >=3.8.0 and Flutter >=3.32.0
- netlify.toml: Updated FLUTTER_VERSION to 3.32.0
- scripts/project_config.sh: Updated FLUTTER_VERSION to 3.32.0
- .github/workflows/deploy_web_firebase.yaml: Updated flutter-version to 3.32.0
- .github/workflows/deploy_web_github_pages.yaml: Updated flutter-version to 3.32.0
- netlify_deploy.md: Updated documentation reference to Flutter 3.32.0
- Other workflow files already use dynamic version extraction from project config
