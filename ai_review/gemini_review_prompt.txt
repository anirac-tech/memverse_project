I have two files with questions about a Flutter codebase (questions-L1.md and questions-L2.md). 
Questions-L1.md contains beginner-friendly questions that junior developers might have, and 
questions-L2.md contains more advanced questions for senior developers.

Please review these questions and create detailed, comprehensive answers for each one based on 
best practices in Flutter development, software architecture, and modern mobile application 
development. For each question:

1. Repeat the question for clarity
2. Provide a detailed answer that covers:
   - Direct response to the question
   - Context and rationale behind the recommendation
   - Practical examples or code snippets where applicable
   - References to relevant documentation or best practices
   - Potential trade-offs or alternative approaches

Format your answers in markdown with proper headings, bullet points, and formatting to make them 
easy to read. Organize the answers in the same order as the questions appear in the original files, 
and match the level of technical depth to the audience (more approachable for L1, more advanced for L2).

After creating your answers, please provide a self-assessment of your responses, highlighting:
- The strengths and weaknesses of your approach
- Any areas where you had to make assumptions due to missing information
- Suggestions for how the questions could be improved for clarity

Your goal is to create a helpful, educational resource that would genuinely assist developers 
working on this codebase, balancing technical accuracy with practical usability.
