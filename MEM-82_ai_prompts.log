[2025-04-24 03:01:39 PM] this did not achieve the goal of the git hash in the version number, please add it to build.gradle after all so that if the hash is "e68da18" then this hash is in the version listed in the OS app info that is visible to the android device user. also make sure this prompt goes in the prompts file
[2025-04-24 03:04:29 PM] please make the release script rename the apk to memverse0.1.140d7a66.apk or similar and automatically run adb install to conected device and echo instructions before and after so they have a device connected and know what to look for to confirm it worked. thanks!

[2025-04-24 04:54:57 PM] do it please
[2025-04-24 04:56:28 PM] let's make it a staging debug built like in the other script please and with the dart define
[2025-04-24 04:59:11 PM] please put the two scripts under an android directory and update the readme on usage and put a todo comment with MEM-84 next to it for the create release script that isn't quite ready yet.
[2025-04-24 05:00:28 PM] create release. also make a tod comment about use fastlane for some of this eventually
[2025-04-24 05:05:32 PM] got the error "Building staging debug APK with flavor 'staging'...
Target file "lib/main.dart" not found.  "  also i think you created a new script when you didn't need to; remove creat_release_apk.sh if it is unneeded but move create_release.sh to the android subdir.  then run the script right now to see if it works and fix any issues
[2025-04-24 05:05:32 PM] Okay, let's address the error and the script organization.
You're right, the error `Target file "lib/main.dart" not found` usually means the `flutter build` command wasn't run from your project's root directory (`/Users/neil/AndroidStudioProjects/memverse_project`). Even if you run the script *from* the root, sometimes the execution context can be tricky.
Regarding the scripts: My apologies for the confusion. You asked to "create release", so I created a new script specifically for building the *production release* APK (`create_release_apk.sh`), separate from the script that builds and installs the *staging debug* APK (`release_and_install.sh`). It's generally good practice to have separate scripts for different build types (like debug vs. release, staging vs. production).
Here's what I'll do:
1.  **Log your request:** Add this message to the log file.
2.  **Rename Scripts for Clarity:**
    *   Rename `scripts/android/release_and_install.sh` to `scripts/android/build_and_install_staging_debug.sh`.
    *   Rename `scripts/android/create_release_apk.sh` to `scripts/android/build_production_release.sh`.
3.  **Fix Execution Path:** Add a command at the beginning of *both* scripts to explicitly change the directory to your project root before running any `flutter` or `git` commands. This will ensure they work correctly regardless of where you execute them from.
4.  **Update README:** Adjust the `README.md` to reflect the new script names and locations.
5.  **Run the Staging Script:** I will attempt to run the `./scripts/android/build_and_install_staging_debug.sh` script for you to see if the path fix works and catch any other potential errors.
Let's start with renaming and fixing the scripts.
[2025-04-24 05:07:43 PM] yes,do it please
[2025-04-24 05:07:43 PM] Okay, I'll proceed with the plan.
First, I'll log your confirmation.
[2025-04-24 05:11:24 PM] not google signin, just the dart define for clientid already in setup.md and test setup, don't create new env variable stuff
[2025-04-24 05:11:24 PM] Got it. Apologies for the misunderstanding about the Client IDs. We'll use the existing `MEMVERSE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable as shown in `setup.md` for both scripts.
Here's the plan:
1.  **Log your request.**
2.  **Update Staging Script:** Add `--dart-define=CLIENT_ID=$MEMVERSE_CLIENT_ID` to the `flutter build` command in `scripts/android/build_and_install_staging_debug.sh`. Also, add the `adb` command to retrieve the `versionName` after installation.
3.  **Update Production Script:** Add `-t lib/main_production.dart` (assuming this is the correct entry point) and `--dart-define=CLIENT_ID=$MEMVERSE_CLIENT_ID` to the `flutter build` command in `scripts/android/build_production_release.sh`.
4.  **Update README:** Reflect the changes in the build commands and the added version check step in the staging script.
Let's modify the scripts.
[2025-04-24 05:12:42 PM] ok i guess. please try it and see if it works.
[2025-04-24 05:24:57 PM] I will log your request and then run the updated `build_and_install_staging_debug.sh` script to see if it works with the added `CLIENT_ID` dart-define and the `adb` version check.
