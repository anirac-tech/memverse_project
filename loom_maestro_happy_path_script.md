### 📖 Verse Review Journey - Correct Answer (90 seconds)

**[Screen: Focus on device showing first verse]**

> "Now comes the heart of Memverse - verse memorization practice. Let's see how our feedback system
> works:
>
> **[Show first verse interaction]**
> The app presents: 'What is the reference for this verse?'
> Maestro enters: 'Col 1:17' - which is the correct answer
>
> **[Watch green feedback appear]**
> Beautiful! See that green feedback? That tells the user they got it exactly right. This positive
> reinforcement is crucial for learning. Our app celebrates success with:
> - Clear visual confirmation (green color)
> - Encouraging message
> - Immediate progression to the next challenge
>
> This validates that our reward system motivates continued learning."

### 🟠 Almost Correct Feedback (90 seconds)

**[Screen: Device showing second verse interaction]**

> "But what happens when users are close but not perfect? Let's see our intelligent feedback system:
>
> **[Show second verse interaction]**
> The app expects: 'Gal 5:1'
> Maestro enters: 'Gal 5:2' - almost correct, just one verse off
>
> **[Watch orange feedback appear]**
> Excellent! See that orange/amber feedback? This is our 'almost correct' response. It tells users:
> - 'You're very close!'
> - Shows what they entered vs. what was expected
> - Encourages them to try again without being discouraging
>
> This nuanced feedback helps users learn without frustration. It's not a harsh 'wrong' - it's '
> you're on the right track!'"

### 🔴 Incorrect Response Handling (90 seconds)

**[Screen: Device showing third verse interaction]**

> "Now let's see how we handle completely incorrect responses - this is crucial for user experience:
>
> **[Show third verse interaction]**
> The app expects one verse, Maestro enters a completely different reference
>
> **[Watch red feedback appear]**
> Perfect! The red feedback clearly but kindly indicates an incorrect answer. Notice how our app:
> - Uses red color for clear visual communication
> - Provides the correct answer for learning
> - Doesn't make the user feel bad - just redirects learning
> - Keeps them engaged rather than frustrated
>
> This three-tier feedback system (green/orange/red) creates a supportive learning environment that
> adapts to different levels of accuracy."

### 🔄 Rollover Functionality (60 seconds)

**[Screen: Device showing progression to next verse set]**

> - Maintains user progress and momentum
> - Provides seamless continuation of the learning experience
>
