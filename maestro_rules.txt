# Maestro E2E Testing Rules & Best Practices

## App Launch Configuration
- Use `launchApp` without clearState/clearKeychain for most tests to avoid connection issues
- Only use clearState when specifically testing fresh app state
- App must be installed on device before running tests

## Flutter App Specifics
- This is a flavored Flutter app that requires `main_development.dart` as the entry point
- CLIENT_ID environment variable is required for builds and app functionality
- Build with: `flutter build apk --debug --target lib/main_development.dart --dart-define=CLIENT_ID=$CLIENT_ID`
- Install with: `flutter install --debug --target lib/main_development.dart --dart-define=CLIENT_ID=$CLIENT_ID`

## Login Validation Testing
- Empty field validation messages:
  - Username: "Please enter your username" 
  - Password: "Please enter your password"
- Form validation happens on Login button tap
- Use `assertVisible` with exact text match for validation messages

## Common Issues & Solutions
- "Unable to launch app" error: App not installed on device
- Connection timeouts: Avoid clearState/clearKeychain unless necessary
- Text assertions failing: Check exact text match including case and punctuation

## Test Structure Best Practices
- Take screenshots before and after critical actions
- Use `waitForAnimationToEnd` after user interactions
- Group related tests with appropriate tags
- Use descriptive screenshot names for debugging

## Device Requirements
- Android device connected via ADB
- App package: com.spiritflightapps.memverse
- Ensure device has sufficient permissions for app installation
