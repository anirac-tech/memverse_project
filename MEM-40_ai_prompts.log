**Task:** Fix range error length invalid_value on the reference page

**Issue:** The app was experiencing an "Invalid Range" error when going through all verses and trying to access a verse beyond the available list

**Solution:**
1. Fixed the `loadNextVerse()` method in `MemversePage` to properly check if we've reached the end of verses and wrap back to the first verse
2. Added index range checking in both small screen and regular layout for `currentVerseIndex`
3. Created a test to verify the fix works as expected
4. Added script for pre-commit checks that runs dart fix, formatting, analysis, and tests
