# MEM-95: Integrate Bugsee Advanced User Feedback and Bug Reporting SDK

## Description

Enhance the Memverse app's feedback and bug reporting capabilities by integrating the Bugsee SDK.
This will enable more comprehensive feedback collection including video recording, network logs,
console logs, and crash reports. This implementation will augment the existing share-based feedback
mechanism.

## User Story

As a Memverse app user, I want to be able to provide detailed feedback and bug reports with minimal
effort, so that the development team can quickly understand and fix issues I encounter.

As a Memverse developer, I want to receive detailed bug reports with session recordings, logs, and
system information, so that I can efficiently diagnose and fix issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Bugsee SDK is properly integrated in the Android app
2. Bugsee SDK is properly integrated in the iOS app
3. Users can trigger feedback/bug reporting via UI button
4. Session recording captures user actions prior to bug report submission
5. Device information and system metrics are included in reports
6. Console logs and crash reports are captured automatically
7. Network requests are captured and included in reports
8. Sensitive user data is properly masked
9. Integration works alongside the existing feedback mechanism
10. Reports are viewable in the Bugsee dashboard
11. Jira integration is configured for automatic ticket creation
12. Documentation is provided for maintaining and extending the implementation

## Technical Details

- Separate implementation required for Android and iOS platforms
- SDK will need to be initialized in native code
- Flutter method channel needed for communication with native SDK
- Documentation available at https://docs.bugsee.com/

## Dependencies

- Android implementation: `com.bugsee:bugsee-android:x.y.z`
- iOS implementation: CocoaPods `Bugsee` or Swift Package Manager
- Existing Flutter feedback mechanism

## Subtasks

1. **MEM-95.1:** Set up Bugsee account and application tokens
2. **MEM-95.2:** Implement Android integration
3. **MEM-95.3:** Implement iOS integration
4. **MEM-95.4:** Create Flutter method channel interface
5. **MEM-95.5:** Configure privacy settings for sensitive data
6. **MEM-95.6:** Configure Jira integration
7. **MEM-95.7:** Document implementation and maintenance procedures

## Additional Information

The implementation should start with one platform (preferably Android) to validate the approach
before proceeding with the second platform. The integration should be designed to work alongside the
existing share-based feedback mechanism to provide both options to users.
