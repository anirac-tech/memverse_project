# Verse Text Quiz (`verse_text_quiz`)

This feature/module provides the 'Verse Text Quiz' where users are prompted with a verse reference (
e.g. 'Gal 5:22'), and must type out the text of the verse from memory.

- UI and flow based on memverse mockup and requirements, under 'Verse' tab in new signed-in
  navigation.
- Distinct from the Reference Quiz (now 'Ref' tab).
