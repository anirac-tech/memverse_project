### 2025-05-03 12:04:00 PM - Update AI Prompts Log

**User Prompt**: Okay, I understand that the review file wasn't created in the previous attempt. My
apologies for that oversight. I will now perform the complete request again:

1. Update AI Prompts Log: I'll modify `MEM-102_3_may_2025_ai_prompts_log.md` to ensure model
   information (Claude-3.7 Sonnet or Gemini 2.5 Pro) is included with each response summary and
   remove the top-level model section. I will also add the previous prompt and this current one to
   the log.
2. Review Branch vs. Main: I'll conceptually review the significant changes made in this branch:

* Standardized logging with `AppLogger`.
* Enforcement via pre-commit hook and CI check.
* Extensive documentation (logging, flavors, PWA).
* Initial attempt at custom lint rules (with known dependency issues).
* CI fixes for formatting.
* Creation of question/review documents.

3. Update Question Files: I'll add contextual comments to `questions-L1.md` and `questions-L2.md`
   based on the review. For example:

* *L1 Logging*: (Addressed via `logging.md`, CI checks, pre-commit hook, and lint rules)
* *L1 Flavors*: (Addressed via `flavors_info_*.md` files)
* *L2 Lint Conflicts*: (Identified as a key issue needing resolution)
* *L2 CI Formatting*: (Partially addressed via script and analysis exclusion, but underlying issue
  remains)

4. Create Review File: I will create the `gemini2.5pro_review.md` file.
5. Log Current Prompt: This interaction will be added to the log file.
   **AI Response Summary (Gemini 2.5 Pro)**:

- Updated the AI prompts log to remove the top-level model information section and add the specific
  model used for each response.

  documentation, lint rules, and CI fixes.
- Added comments to `questions-L1.md` and `questions-L2.md` based on the review.
- Created the `gemini2.5pro_review.md` file with the review, proposed changes, concerns, and next
  steps.

### 2025-05-03 12:15:12 PM - Enhance Logging Violation Output and Auto-Fix

**User Prompt**: make sure the script and github action both log the line number and line the
debugPrint() or similar violation occurs in and info on how to fix. If it's the local script then
perform the fix in the script . nore this log in the ai prompts log file
**AI Response Summary (Gemini 2.5 Pro)**:

- Modified `scripts/check_before_commit.sh` to use `grep -rn` for line numbers.
- Added `sed` commands to attempt auto-fixing `debugPrint` and ` log` to `AppLogger.d`.
- Added logic using `ed` to insert `AppLogger` import if missing.
- Ensured the script still exits with an error code (1) to force review of auto-fixes.
- Updated the `check-logging-standards` job in `.github/workflows/main.yaml` to use `grep -rn` and
  provide clearer error output including file, line number, and offending code.
