2025-04-24 08:47:25 PM - Gemini 2.5 Pro - User: I want to implement a feedback feature that allows users to submit feedback, including screenshots. We should use the feedback package for capturing the screenshots and text, but I need it to work with sharing.

2025-04-24 09:12:36 PM - Gemini 2.5 Pro - Implementation started: Added feedback and share_plus packages to pubspec.yaml, implemented BetterFeedback wrapper in App widget, added feedback button to MemversePage.

2025-04-24 10:43:18 PM - Gemini 2.5 Pro - Found issue with null check error in localization. Attempted several approaches to fix the context issue but facing persistent errors.

2025-04-25 12:01:45 AM - Gemini 2.5 Pro - User: Let's simplify the approach. Remove AboutScreen and focus on a minimal implementation of the feedback feature with just the button.

2025-04-25 12:21:32 AM - Gemini 2.5 Pro - Successfully implemented the feedback feature. Added 'feedback' package (v3.1.0), configured BetterFeedback wrappe2025-04-24 08:47:25 PM - Gemini 2.5to
