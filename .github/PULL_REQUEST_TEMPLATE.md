# 🚀 Comprehensive Marketing Technology Foundation with Environment-Aware Analytics

## Jira Tickets

- [MEM-146](https://anirac-tech.atlassian.net/browse/MEM-146): Android POC for session replay and
  basic analytics (Enhanced)

## Changes vs. Origin/Main

This branch establishes a comprehensive marketing technology foundation with clean,
environment-aware analytics architecture and strategic roadmap for user satisfaction optimization:

### 🎯 **Enhanced Analytics Service Architecture**:

- **Environment-Aware Tracking**: Added `entry_point`, `app_flavor`, and `environment` properties
  with automatic API URL detection
- **AnalyticsBootstrap Service**: Centralized initialization supporting main_development,
  main_staging, main_production entry points
- **Type-Safe Configuration**: Environment enums (production, staging, development) with API URL
  mapping
- **Clean Architecture**: Removed direct PostHog dependencies from main files, service abstraction
  with multiple implementations
- **Future-Ready Design**: Easy migration to separate PostHog projects per environment when needed

### 📊 **Comprehensive Property Tracking**:

- `entry_point`: main_development | main_staging | main_production
- `app_flavor`: development | staging | production
- `environment`: dev | staging | prod (auto-detected from API URL)
- `environment_api_url`: Full API endpoint for validation
- `debug_mode`: Flutter build configuration awareness
- `platform`: web | android | ios | etc.
- `is_emulator`/`is_simulator`: Device type detection for clean analytics separation

### 🌍 **Environment Documentation & Strategy**:

- **Technical Guide** (`environments_technical.md`): Build commands, configuration management,
  deployment pipeline
- **Product Guide** (`environments_product.md`): User-friendly environment explanation for
  stakeholders
- **Environment Structure**:
    - Development: `memverse-dev.netlify.app` + `https://api-dev.memverse.com`
    - Staging: `memverse-staging.netlify.app` + `https://api-staging.memverse.com`
    - Production: `memverse.com` + `https://api.memverse.com`

### 🚀 **MarTech Strategy & Roadmap**:

- **Epic Documentation**: Complete user satisfaction & analytics platform strategy
- **Implementation Stories**: Detailed emoji feedback system with acceptance criteria
- **2025 Roadmap**: 4-phase plan with budget projections and success metrics
- **37signals Philosophy Integration**: "Half product, not half-baked" approach with room to grow

### 📋 **Strategic Phases Planned**:

- **Phase 1 (Q2 2025)**: ✅ PostHog + 😊 Emoji Feedback + 📊 NPS Surveys
- **Phase 2 (Q3-Q4 2025)**: 🔥 Firebase Analytics Migration + Advanced Segmentation
- **Phase 3 (2026)**: ⭐ Review Automation + 🔒 Private Feedback Routing
- **Phase 4 (Someday/Maybe)**: 🔮 Predictive Analytics + 🎯 Personalization

### 🛠️ **Technology Stack Vision**:

- **Current**: PostHog (session replay, web analytics, privacy-focused)
- **Migration**: Firebase Analytics (mobile-optimized, Google ecosystem)
- **Feedback**: Wiredash (NPS), Custom Emoji System, Private Channels
- **Communication**: Firebase In-App Messaging, Review APIs
- **Processing**: Supabase Functions, GitHub Actions automation

### 💡 **37signals-Inspired Philosophy**:

- **Complete Features**: Simple emoji feedback system (fully functional)
- **Not Half-Baked**: Avoid complex dashboards without clear user value
- **Room to Grow**: Start simple, add value incrementally
- **User-Centric**: Respectful data collection with clear value exchange
