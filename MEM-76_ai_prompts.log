**User Query** (2025-04-10 07:32:54 PM): are you sure that line 37 in the pipeline is correct, maybe it should be ${{ needs.extract-config.outputs.min_coverage }} instead of min-coverage: ${{ needs.extract-config.outputs.min_coverage }} or maybe you can properly convert to int or something.

## AI Prompts File Reorganization (2025-04-10 07:29:00 PM)

**User Query** (2025-04-10 07:29:00 PM): that's cool you improved localization but remember the ai prompts file should be fresh, please delete the old one and make the new one be MEM-76 to match branch name and modify the firebender rules to do this in the future. also please check to see if it seems like it will pass PR review by main.yaml and coderabbit and attempt to add a test for the eye if you didn't already, and make it use fat arrow for the one-line methods and make sure this prompt gets saved to the ai interactions file

**Duration**: Approximately 25 minutes (in progress)

### 1. AI Prompts Log File Reorganization
