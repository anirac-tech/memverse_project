**User Prompt**: add a thin analytics wrapper riverpod singleton and add simple events for posthog for every reasonable event such as login, feedback_trigger, logout, login_failure_after_network_call, verse_incorrect, verse_correct, verse_nearly_correct and whatever else you can think of.Include the verse reference in the event and make sure it's a riverpod singleton that is very easy to overrice with a log provider or a no-op provider for testing or kDebugMode or certain flavors as we see fit later (but for now use the posthog analytics in all non-automated-test scenarios.

**AI Response Summary**: Starting to implement analytics wrapper with Riverpod singleton pattern for PostHog integration with comprehensive event tracking.

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**: Analytics Service Integration

**Summary**: Successfully implemented comprehensive analytics wrapper with Riverpod singleton pattern:

**Core Implementation:**
- âœ… Created `AnalyticsService` abstract base class with 12+ tracking methods
- âœ… Implemented `PostHogAnalyticsService` for production analytics
- âœ… Created `LoggingAnalyticsService` for debug/development with ðŸ“Š emoji logging
- âœ… Added `NoOpAnalyticsService` for testing scenarios
- âœ… Setup Riverpod provider (`analyticsServiceProvider`) for easy override

**Event Tracking Implemented:**
- `user_login` - Track successful logins with username
- `user_logout` - Track user logout events  
- `login_failure_after_network_call` - Track login failures with error details
- `feedback_trigger` - Track feedback modal opening
- `verse_correct` - Track correct verse answers with reference
- `verse_incorrect` - Track incorrect answers with reference and user input
- `verse_nearly_correct` - Track nearly correct answers with details
- `verse_displayed` - Track verse presentation to users
- `app_opened` - Track app startup/session start
- `practice_session_start` - Track verse practice beginning
- `practice_session_complete` - Track session completion with metrics
- `navigation` - Track screen navigation events

**Integration Points:**
- âœ… Integrated into `AuthNotifier` for login/logout tracking
- âœ… Added to `MemversePage` for verse interaction tracking
- âœ… Connected to feedback system for user feedback events
- âœ… All events include relevant context (verse references, user inputs, etc.)

**Testing & Quality:**
- âœ… Fixed all test files to work with new analytics service parameter
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite (`analytics_service_test.dart`)
- âœ… All 19 lint issues resolved (only minor info-level warnings remain)
- âœ… Code follows project standards with AppLogger integration
- âœ… Passed `check_before_commit.sh` validation

**Architecture Benefits:**
- Easy to override for different environments (test vs debug vs production)
- Type-safe event tracking with proper error handling
- Fails gracefully - analytics errors don't crash the app
- Consistent event naming and property structure
- Ready for future enhancement (custom properties, user identification, etc.)

The analytics system is now fully integrated and ready for production use with PostHog

2025-06-04 12:23:20 AM - User requested implementation of unimplemented BDD test steps for integration tests

PROMPT: "iamloggedinas a user step is unimplemented, please imlement it per test_setup.md and in fact implement all the othert unimplemented steps as well pleasE"

IMPLEMENTED STEPS:
- i_am_logged_in_as_test_user.dart: Implemented login step using USERNAME/PASSWORD environment variables from test_setup.md
- i_see_feedback_interface.dart: Implemented feedback UI detection step
- the_app_is_starting_up.dart: Implemented app startup simulation step
- i_see_loading_indicator.dart: Implemented loading indicator detection step
- i_see_login_page.dart: Implemented login page verification step
- i_enter_test_credentials_into_login_fields.dart: Implemented credential entry step
- i_tap_login_button.dart: Implemented login button tap step
- i_tap_submit_button.dart: Implemented submit button tap step
- i_see_verse_text.dart: Implemented verse text verification step

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Used environment variables (USERNAME, PASSWORD) as specified in test_setup.md
- Implemented steps use proper Flutter test finders and keys defined in UI components
- All steps include proper error handling and expect statements
- Code follows Dart conventions and passes dart fix --apply

RESULT: All referenced BDD test steps in app_ui_bdd_test_test.dart are now implemented and ready for testing
